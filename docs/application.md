# Application

Application contains nodes that interact with documents open in Revit or other general Application-level tasks. 

_Why are some of the titles plural? Because there was a [major bug in Dynamo](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/issues/8981) that I needed to avoid and making the class plural was the only way I knew how to do it quickly._
