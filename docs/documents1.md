# Document Nodes

Documents contains the individual nodes for Revit that interact with the Document. Why is this title plural? Because there was a [major bug in Dynamo](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/issues/8981) that I needed to avoid and making the class plural was the only way I knew how to do it quickly._
